write a readme in two parts
    - user section
        - short videos with explanation and input overlay
    - programmer section

simplify
    - make Gui static?

prettify
    - slider shader should use theme colors rather than a hardcoded black/gray gradient

manually create a few processing examples from the existing pure java examples

streamline
    - gui factory where you OPT INTO advanced features like saving, themes

optimize save file size
    - only include non-transient nodes in json (pretty print already does this)

ensure font availability
    - decide on a font and package it with the library
